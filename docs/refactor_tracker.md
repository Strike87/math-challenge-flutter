- [x] R5 Step 2A — Survival scoring branch audit
- [x] R5 Step 2B — Survival scoring characterization
  - Verified evidence:
    - `test/survival_boss_event_test.dart` contains the valid Survival scoring
      characterization
    - Focused Survival tests: 2 passed
    - Question timer tests: 19 passed
    - Achievement tests: 10 passed
    - Full non-golden suite: 252 passed
    - Visual parity suite: 13 passed
    - `flutter analyze`: clean
    - `regression_reviewer` reported no confirmed findings
- [x] R5 Step 2C — VERIFIED, no code change
  - The unsupported but publicly constructible `Survival + Master` branch is
    retained for executable-reference parity; any coherence guard requires a
    separate behavior-matrix audit and product decision.
